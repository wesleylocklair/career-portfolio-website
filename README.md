# career-portfolio-website

## In this project I made my own Portfolio/career website! With this project I can build an active/updateable website that can act as a portfolio and a resume. This project in itself has been, and will be very educational. I have struggled with advanced CSS and being able to set up an interactive website has been very enjoyable. I plan on continuing work on this and making it bigger and better as I learn more and get time to work on it and progress.
